# NGINX-Notes

This repository contains bits and pieces of NGINX notes and/or codes related to NGINX.
This repository was never (still is not) and will never be (nor even trying to be) any kind of reference of NGINX implementation nor NGINX configuration.

Reader is strongly urged and recommended to refer to official NGINX references and/or resources (below are only ***examples*** of such references and/or resources):
- [ ] Obvious ones will be the official sites of each of NGINX products:
  - [ ] [NGINX Open Source](https://nginx.org/en/)
  - [ ] [NGINX Plus Documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/)
  - [ ] [NGINX Unit Site](https://unit.nginx.org/), [NGINX Unit Latest Release Notes](https://unit.nginx.org/CHANGES.txt), [NGINX Unit Mail List Archive](https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/unit/)

- [ ] [NGINX.org Mail Lists](https://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo)
- [ ] [NGINX Support](https://www.nginx.com/support/) (most probably you'll need a valid support contract though)

"Then why do you even bother to build the repository?".
The repository is built for my personal usage which sometimes in sync with some other people need (small group of people).
Therefore codes which I have built are shared publicly for the ones which have similar requirements / goals.

When you are using or copying the codes, kindly also note that things may have change between when the code was written and when you adopt it.
Should you have any issue (example: the code is no longer valid; or the code use deprecated method / function / procedure / module / etc.), kindly refer to the official NGINX references and/or resources.
